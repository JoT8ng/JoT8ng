# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jocelyn Tang!
I am a software developer with a background in architecture and GIS (Geographic Information Systems). My journey into tech began with automating tasks and creating software to improve efficiency in my architectural work. I discovered a passion for developing software that solves real-world problems and automates tasks.

I have a keen interest in working with data, particularly geospatial data. I enjoy analyzing and processing data to find patterns and create visualizations. My experience includes developing GIS web applications for climate advocacy work with an NGO, where I leveraged geospatial data to drive impactful projects.

I believe my skills and previous work experiences are transferable to software engineering. Some of the skills I can bring are: 
- complex problem solving
- ability to adapt quickly to different working enviornments and learn new software
- project management
- graphic design
- team collaboration
- synthesizing complex information
- critical thinking
- communication and presentation skills.

I am committed to continuous learning and mastering new technologies to develop innovative solutions.

### Some things I'm up to
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **C#, Docker, GDAL, and Amazon AWS**!
- I'm playing around with Leaflet and Mapbox!
